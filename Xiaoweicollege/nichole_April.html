  <p class="about-two">The place is located in Wujiaochang. <br>
  An outside and inside climbing club is nearby as well. <br>

		<p><span class="first">H</span>appy time with zyh,zqw&zyy <br>
    We spent whole afternoon in a studio which is located in Jiangan. I chose the<b> Eiffel Tower</b> to mimic. A teacher there helped me to polish my painting up a lot.<img src ="effi.jpg" width="167" height="288"/>Painting is enjoyable, it makes me calm down. I have to focus on the outline and every corner, details of the picture, the proportion is vital to make a vivid painting.
		<p class="left3-p2">The method of oil painting is quite different from the painting i used to know. I could hardly to memorize some painting techiques i learned in my childhood. It has been a long time before i painted this time, which is a pity.</p>
		<p class="left3-p2">To my great surprise, everbody seems to achieve a vivid painting. It seems that an adult will possess mature visual and perceptual sikll. By contrast, children need hard exercise and longer time to achieve something</p>
